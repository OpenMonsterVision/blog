# The What
[dndshell](https://github.com/bsdpunk/dndshell/) Is a shell I made so you can quickly, access Monsters and other rules(spells/races/classes/dice roles), in text/json format. Most of the leg work for the rules was done by this project [5e-database](https://github.com/adrpadua/5e-database). You can expand the rules by simply editing the JSON files that come with the shell. To install it's:
``` bash
go get github.com/bsdpunk/dndshell
```

# The Why
I spend a lot of my time on the command line, and it's the most intuitive way for me to solve problems. Automating with bash or zsh, is second nature to me. If I want to build an encounter I could do so quickly. For Example
