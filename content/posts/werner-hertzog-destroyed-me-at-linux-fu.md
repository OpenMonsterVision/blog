# The Who

I am @bsdpunk and I think I am good at things, particularly interviews and linux. I fancy myself a pretty good interviewer. I'm a goofball...like cringe worthy goofy. I usually use this to my advantage in an interview. I do my goofy laugh, at the start and when I get something wrong, I say some weird dad joke or something, and then I'm determined non-threatening, which I am. But I'm also quite knowledgable, and can usually find a few things in the interview I know more about in the interim, and the lovable goofball wins everybody over. Werner Hertzog, was not having it.

# With Who

A big company, you know them. 

# For

An SRE (Site Reliabily Engineer / Linux  ) role.

# The How

## Questions
        You may or may not know this, but it's taboo to share interview questions. And I'm not, but not because of that. This interview had very few actual questions. It was more like how does this part of linux work. Keep going. No...Keep going.

## The Experience

So I called into my conference call, and when the person answered...it was Werner Hertzog. I could tell, because of the voice. "Is it safe to say all of your experience is support", I said "No sir", Werner Hertzog informed me, that Werener Hertzog was not a sir. It was unclear whether like so many men, Werner was uncomfortable with being called sir, or if Werner was a lday. I managed to only call Werner sir, one more time. It was trying, I was raised in a strict southern household...all authority figures were sir. Sorry, Werner. So then lady Hertzong says

## The Who Again

I am @bsdpunk and my resume is written in LaTeX. I really got to pick up a devOps tool like Ansible, so I picked up [this]()
