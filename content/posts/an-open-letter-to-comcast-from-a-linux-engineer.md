# The Who
I am an linux engineer, who works from home, you can call me Ishmael...errr, [@bsdpunk](https://twitter.com/bsdpunk)

# The Why

What the fuck! My internet has been down for as long as it takes to drive to Florida. What the fuck. Do something you sack of shits.

# But...A Blog Post Needs More

Fuck Comcast. With the Washington Memorial.

# Just an extra thing

We were going to have our cat's blessed by a priest tomorrow...a not common occourence. And yeah no I don't believe. God is like the silliest construct ever, and dumb. And Fuck Pascal's wager...fuck it for me. But my cat Charley, he deserves the benefit of Pascal's Wager. Fuck you comcast.

# Also You Need to Be Taken to Task

Why the fuck can I sign to an xfinitywifi hotspot...WHICH IS CLEARLY HOSTED ON MY ROUTER...but not use my own goddamn router. Go home Xfinity, comcast, whatever you call yourself,  your drunk.
