      <description>The What dndshell Is a shell I made so you can quickly, access Monsters and other rules(spells/races/classes/dice roles), in text/json format. Most of the leg work for the rules was done by this project 5e-database. You can expand the rules by simply editing the JSON files that come with the shell. To install it&amp;rsquo;s:
go get github.com/bsdpunk/dndshell  The shell has tab completion and history for the session you are in.</description>

      <description>The What I found a PDF copy of the monster manual (Of course I also own a copy, but I needed digital for this). I was able to grep out all the tables for monster stats&amp;hellip;however, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a way to programatically get their names so I assigned them ID numbers. Git Repo
GNU vs BSD Tools Though generally I script on my mac, I use the gnu tools vs the bsd tools.</description>

      <description>The Wrong Way Worse Is Better As a grubby unix hacker, I usually take the easy way on my projects. And as of late, I have been getting fairly simple data conversion jobs from various freelancing sites and customers. So of course, worse is better is my go to philosophy. Well this dug &amp;lsquo;ol @bsdpunk into a little hole. I got a couple of example JSON files, from a guy who said he had a lot of data and wanted to turn them into a single CSV, to load into BigQuery.</description>
