      <description>That time I was employed by a criminal organization I was employed by Micfo for several months, I quickly determined that they were shady and invovled in illegal practices. I did not quit because of that, I quit because I felt unwanted, by HR and Management. Later they would ask me to come back. This is the full story. There will be amazon affiliate links at the end of the page in the epiloge(I am currently unemployed).</description>

      <description>The What I lied, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a goddamned conversation, there&amp;rsquo;s no commenting on this blog. You&amp;rsquo;re going to listen to why the title recruiter is another way of saying &amp;ldquo;demon from the really lame Dante&amp;rsquo;s Inferno level, where you waste time for all eternity&amp;rdquo;. There are exceptions of course, see the section entitled The Exceptions.
The Why I have been hurt by recruiters, but that&amp;rsquo;s not what makes them such a wonderful target.</description>

      <description>I am an Expert Let&amp;rsquo;s establish the parameters of what makes me an expert on not getting an elite job with a tech company. I have interviewed for an SRE(Site Reliability Engineer) role, at both Google and facebook, and failed to achieve those positions. Last month I interviewed for an SRE for one of the top 25 most visited sites, and also failed to achieve that position. Why on September 13th I didn&amp;rsquo;t even bother to respond to this Vimeo voice mail I am the Michael Jordan, of not achieving an engineering position with elite Silicon Valley tech companies.</description>
