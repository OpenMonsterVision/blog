      <description>That time I was employed by a criminal organization I was employed by Micfo for several months, I quickly determined that they were shady and invovled in illegal practices. I did not quit because of that, I quit because I felt unwanted, by HR and Management. Later they would ask me to come back. This is the full story. There will be amazon affiliate links at the end of the page in the epiloge(I am currently unemployed).</description>
