<h1 id="i-am-an-expert">I am an Expert</h1>

<p>Let&rsquo;s establish the parameters of what makes me an expert on not getting an elite job with a tech company. I have interviewed for an SRE(Site Reliability Engineer) role, at both Google and facebook, and failed to achieve those positions. Last month I interviewed for an SRE for one of the top 25 most visited sites, and also failed to achieve that position. Why on September 10th I didn&rsquo;t even bother to respond to this Vimeo voice mail <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BT7zpni.png" alt="visual voicemail" title="Visual VoiceMail" /></p>

<p>I am the Michael Jordan, of not achieving an engineering position with elite Silicon Valley tech companies. Now your thinking, well you must not be good at what you do. Oh contraire, I am. In some of these interviews, I have passed the coding part, and in some the operations part. And in some none or all.</p>

<h1 id="well-if-you-re-so-good-you-must-be-a-psychopath-or-have-crazy-videos-floating-around">Well if you&rsquo;re so good, you must be a psychopath or have crazy videos floating around.</h1>

<p>Well, yeah. <a href="https://sphere.ms">Sphere</a> once sent me an application for a go developer position, that requested I send back an essay that discussed how I met their core values. One of those values, was informalness so instead of an essay I sent a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dusty-lane-carver/sphere-interview">sound file</a> explaining I was informal, drunk, and shirtless. They actually advanced me on to the next round, but my code wasn&rsquo;t up to snuff. They didn&rsquo;t like my go CRUD application, <a href="https://github.com/bsdpunk/GetFilthy">getFilthy</a> <img src="https://github.com/bsdpunk/GetFilthy/raw/master/get-filthy.png" alt="alt text" title="Get Filthy" /></p>

<p>Also I routinely answer personality questions strangely:</p>

<p>If you had a theme song, that played when you entered a room what would it be:
&ldquo;Creep&rdquo; audible exhale &ldquo;You know by Radiohead&rdquo; &ldquo;I know&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tell me a joke:
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s big red and eats rocks&rdquo;
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
&ldquo;A big red rock eater&rdquo;
&ldquo;&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that&rdquo;</p>

<p>Can you give me an example of bad customer service:
&ldquo;Comcast, they&rsquo;re the worst, they banned me for two years&rdquo;
&ldquo;Umm&hellip;for what&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh just to much upload, they emailed my Comcast address as an alert but I don&rsquo;t check that so they just banned me&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh my, so what did you use for internet&rdquo;
&ldquo;My neighbors&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh well good thing they didn&rsquo;t use encryption&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, no. It&rsquo;s encrypted&rdquo;</p>

<p>Would I change any of it, if I could? OF COURSE I WOULD, I DON&rsquo;T CHOOSE TO BE THIS WAY.</p>

<h1 id="it-s-an-honor-just-to-be-interviewed">It&rsquo;s an honor just to be interviewed.</h1>
