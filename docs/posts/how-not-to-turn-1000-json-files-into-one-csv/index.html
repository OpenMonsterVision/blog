<h1 id="the-wrong-way">The Wrong Way</h1>

<h2 id="worse-is-better">Worse Is Better</h2>

<p>As a grubby unix hacker, I usually take the easy way on my projects. And as of late, I have been getting fairly <a href="https://openmonstervision.github.io/blog/posts/how-to-make-money-using-grep-sed-and-awk/">simple data conversion</a> jobs from various freelancing sites and customers. So of course, <a href="https://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html">worse is better</a> is my go to philosophy. Well this dug &lsquo;ol <a href="http://twitter.com/bsdpunk">@bsdpunk</a> into a little hole. I got a couple of example JSON files, from a guy who said he had a lot of data and wanted to turn them into a single CSV, to load into BigQuery. The couple of three JSON files he gave me combined so easily, mostly using someone elses <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/json2csv">node module</a>. So I just thought I could get away with a few bash loops, one for converting one for combining, along with a couple lines of sed. No problem, easy peasy lemon squeezey. When he came back and said the price was a little steep, I lowered it because this wasn&rsquo;t going to take very long and what&rsquo;s 20 bucks, I mean really.</p>

<h1 id="humble-bash-begennings">Humble Bash Begennings</h1>

<p>It looked something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">for i in $(find . -name *.json); do cat $i | json2csv -F &gt;&gt; all.csv &amp;&amp; echo $i; done
cat all.csv | sed '/^\&quot;header/d' &gt; noheader.csv
cat */noheader.csv &gt;&gt; header.csv
</code></pre>

<h2 id="sophisticated-bash">Sophisticated Bash</h2>

<p>When I got the rest of the data I was floored. There was so much data. Over 70 gigs. Because of the amount of the data, I knew pretty much instantly this wouldn&rsquo;t work. It was going to be too slow. So, I started parallelizing the bash and running some of the commands individually, or a few in for loop with some single ampersands, instead of in a script. If I knew what I was doing I would have done it more like <a href="http://codehackit.blogspot.be/2013/08/divide-and-conquer-with-bash-and-friends.html">this</a>. But I was in a hurry, and thought this was a good solution.</p>

<h2 id="of-course-it-failed">Of Course It Failed</h2>

<p>The final 53 gig CSV failed. I mean it existed, but it was broke. If you know anything about JSON, you know why. The Objects and how they were populated changed. Of course it did, that&rsquo;s how JSON works. I didn&rsquo;t forsee it because the two files I tested on had the same structure&hellip;yeah I know, sample size. Also dumb, I know.</p>

<h2 id="but-why-why-didn-t-you-just-cancel-the-order">But Why, Why Didn&rsquo;t You Just Cancel the Order</h2>

<p>No one else was, taking orders, from upwork, fiverr, peopleperhour, or guru.com. I even tried to cancel it, but my client suggested just going through with it. And I would have felt terrible cancelling, I hate calling it quits. Especially if someone was relying on me.</p>

<h2 id="so-how-did-you-fix-it">So how did you fix it</h2>

<p>I built a custom parser in Node.js cause you know, the customer deserves his data, and cause I can roll it into a bigger project later. OK I lied&hellip;<a href="http://twitter.com/trozdol">@trozdol</a> told me to, he told me to goddamn #adult.</p>

<p>Example Code from that monstrosity:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var username                      = json[i].user.username || '';
var user_profile_picture          = json[i].user.profile_picture || '';
var user_id                       = json[i].user.id || '';
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Of course in the full thing, there&rsquo;s more than 100 lines of code, not counting the file loader&hellip;so yeah.</li>
</ul>

<p>You know, like a goddamn JSON parser. For some reason I decided it was time to do, <a href="https://yosefk.com/blog/what-worse-is-better-vs-the-right-thing-is-really-about.html">The Right Thing</a>. Of course I am aware these philosophies don&rsquo;t exactly mimic my problem. But if you don&rsquo;t know about them, you need to, and if you do, it&rsquo;s just a silly blog post from a silly person.</p>

<h1 id="javascript-crashed">Javascript Crashed</h1>

<p>I knew I should I have used python&hellip;fuck. Something&rsquo;s funny though, the file it generated was 8 gigs, it should only be around 2. What the fuck.</p>

<h2 id="something-really-dumb">Something Really Dumb</h2>

<p>Hey you guys, I used the same iterator in two for loops. I am dumb, I am Really Really, Dumb.</p>

<h2 id="something-less-dumb">Something Less Dumb</h2>

<p>It still suffered from a crash. Over used the heap, and other sayings. At first I tryed forcing garbage collection, using &ndash;expose-gc flag on node, that made it incrediblly slow and still crash. Next I tried just increasing the max memory node could use&hellip;bob&rsquo;s your uncle. Now it works like a charm. That flag is &ndash;max_old_space_size=7000. That&rsquo;s 7000 Megabytes. Go big or go home.</p>

<h1 id="20-bucks-is-a-lot">20 Bucks Is A Lot</h1>

<p>At this point on this project I&rsquo;m working for about $3.00 an hour, and by the end of it, it will probably be in the two digit cents range, as I haven&rsquo;t quite finished. Still have some details to work out.</p>

<h2 id="wait-a-minute-you-act-like-a-badass-this-sounds-like-you-re-barely-scraping-by">Wait A Minute You Act Like A Badass, This Sounds Like You&rsquo;re Barely Scraping By</h2>

<p>Yeah I eat hot dogs every day. I&rsquo;m still a badass I was offered quite the lucrative gig in The Valley this week, but it meant leaving my girlfriend and cats&hellip;So suck it. I be out here every day failing, I don&rsquo;t give a shit. Come at me bro. Other masculine but meaningless sayings.</p>

<h1 id="on-to-bigger-and-better-things">On to Bigger and Better Things</h1>

<p>I am beginning a larger all encompassing data project, that will slurp data and puke awesome. If you&rsquo;re familiar with me, you know I&rsquo;ve already built something like this before, but that platform was more about using data to create predictive models, and it&rsquo;s time I return to the much more humbler, but also much more viable data cleaning and conversion system.</p>

<h1 id="whose-fault-was-it">Whose fault was it</h1>

<p>Read some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IJ0TWHK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bsdpblog-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00IJ0TWHK&amp;linkId=35eefd37871cbb47a02b0650e3d02812">Camus</a> sometime simpleton, it&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s fault. The world is absurd and the search for meaning ridiculous. Err&hellip; I mean I couldn&rsquo;t have seen ahead given the data I was given. At the beginning of the project with the amount of data, and type of data I was given I foresaw possible issues, but as the eternal optimist, I tredged along.</p>

<h1 id="the-who">The Who</h1>

<p>My name is <a href="http://twitter.com/bsdpunk">@bsdpunk</a>, and I work in the data mines for a living. For apparently very cheap, so you should tottally hit me up. Also I&rsquo;m a socialist who lives with a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ba7bXmwjS0j/?taken-by=bsdpunk">&ldquo;healthy&rdquo; blind cat</a>, and I feel like that joke, writes itself. Also buy that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679720219/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bsdpblog-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0679720219&amp;linkId=49f9264674854c7516a7be2a0b834f7d">Camus</a> book, you uncultured swine. Oh and I know he wants like none of the credit for this awful monstrosity but <a href="http://twitter.com/trozdol">@trozdol</a> contributed and, cleaned up my code so it didn&rsquo;t look like I wrote it. Not that either one us want to claim the final product.</p>
